|What is technical writing for Emmanuel|
In today's  IT industry, I can view the technical writing as one of main pillars of how the IT projects become successful and continue to improve. Ican boldly say that because technical writing has a purpose in any idea that occurs. Its like you cannot exempt technical writing for delevelopment since all of what we do on IT drastically changes and if we don;t have proper docuentation, we don't have a way to struture things, which is what shall be a fundamental of any life cyle of an IT project. We even need to have an application for us to be organize for building an application (e.g., JIRA).

One rapid innovation that challenge the Technical writing role is AI and automation. But little does the technical writers know, these innovation is a opportunity for us to expand into our carreers more. In a very short discussion, I will explain why. First, is the Artificial Intelligence, we commonly know that AI can now write compositions better than us, maybe more. But did you know that AI consumes Data morethan ever and that data must be produced bit by bit and one role that can effectively produced such data is technical writing? We can be an actual engineer for AI. Could you imagine that? In automation, it can be never perfect to apply automation in every tasks for IT development, and us technical writers can be a suport in any flaws, or deficiency that automation has. We can be the administrator for that! Iknow that I have been sounds like bragging or promoting our role, but its not about my opnion, its about my experience and what I can see for the future of technical writing. Its not about extinction for us but its about eveolving. |
